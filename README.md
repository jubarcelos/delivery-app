## My participation in this project:

I started making a setup for frontend applications and collaborating with communication definitions to facilitate the bridge.
We in the bridge team made a map to define the names and structure of our backend and database.
I helped the backend team understand our necessity for different routes and ways to access them.
This strategy permitted the frontend to 'mock' some similar to the developer while the backend structures the database and writes the routes.

In the frontend team, I made the Login page and all components that were used there.
I made the Admin page and refactored the Register page to make both use a similar code.
I made all the utils functions to optimize this Axios request in a dedicated place to that.
I also developed the Address component inside of checkout page.

## This project is not using docker.
## You will need to use the localhost 3000 and 3001 port to access or write an env file.


## About project

This project is like a z√© delivery.
At Brazil, this company is a website to buy things to drink and receive in your home.

Have three classes of users, costumers, sellers and administrator.
We use a JWT token to validate login user and redirect to a correct page.

To explore the page you can register yourself, or try some of them users:

    email: "adm@deliveryapp.com"
    password: "--adm2@21!!--",

    email: "fulana@deliveryapp.com"
    password: "fulana@123",

    email: "zebirita@email.com"
    password: "$#zebirita#$",

## Get this project to your machine:

You will need to use a mySql, if you don't have one, you can use a siple docker to use MySQL.

Go to a repository you like to save it and make a clone:

```git clone git@github.com:jubarcelos/delivery-app.git```

Open the repository and inside the backend, archive create a new file named '.env'
Inside this file write the info about your mySQL configuration:
The repository has a file named '.env.example, you can use that one and rename that.

    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
    MYSQL_HOST=your_host
    HOSTNAME=your_host

Now in the general terminal, execute these commands:

``` npm install ```
``` npm run dev:prestart ```

It will download all the project dependences.

## Start backend:

In the backend terminal, execute this command:

``` npm run dev ```

It will up the DB and start a backend.


## Start frontend:

In the frontend terminal, execute this command:

``` npm start ```

It will up the user web version.

## Things to improve

- [ ] Make a responsive website;
- [ ] Make a docker to run this project;
- [ ] Use a supabase to db;
- [ ] Use a Heroku to the backend repository individual;
- [ ] Use a GitHubPages os another to up the user view page;
- [ ] Reviewer and refactor some other components;
- [ ] End the project, with bonus requirements.
