## My participation in this project:

I started making a setup for frontend applications and collaborating with communication definitions to facilitate the bridge.
We in the bridge team made a map to define the names and structure of our backend and database.
I helped the backend team understand our necessity for different routes and ways to access them.
This strategy permitted the frontend to 'mock' some similar to the developer while the backend structures the database and writes the routes.

In the frontend team, I made the Login page and all components that were used there.
I made the Admin page and refactored the Register page to make both use a similar code.
I made all the utils functions to optimize this Axios request in a dedicated place to that.
I also developed the Address component inside of checkout page.

## This project is not using docker.
## You will need to use the localhost 3000 and 3001 port to access or write an env file.

## Things to improve

- [ ] Make a responsive website;
- [ ] Use a supabase to db;

- [ ] Use a GitHubPages os another to up the user view page;
- [ ] Reviewer and refactor some other components;
- [ ] End the project, with bonus requirements.
